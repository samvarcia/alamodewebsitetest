          <h2>About This Season FW 25 - “Behind the Seen”</h2>
          <p>For the FW25 season, à la mode explores the dualities of appearance and reality, taking you behind the seen. We shine a spotlight on the unseen or lesser-known elements that support and shape what we observe, mirroring the craft of modeling itself—an art form often admired for its surface but driven by unseen dedication, effort, and intent.
Models bridge the gap between what’s visible and the complex narratives behind what we see. Through their poise, movement, and presence, they translate intangible ideas into iconic imagery. FW25 invites audiences to reflect on this interplay—what lies beyond the frame, the preparation behind a pose, and the humanity beneath the glamour.
In essence, this season invites reflection on both the seen and unseen, urging one to look beyond the surface to understand the full picture.</p>
